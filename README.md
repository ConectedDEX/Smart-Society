# Project Title: Digital Mahaveer – Smart Society Management System
Digital Mahaveer is an easy-to-use web platform built to simplify and modernize society management. It helps residents handle their profiles, report daily issues, check available property listings, and stay updated with society announcements. Admins, on the other hand, can post notices, manage listings, and track reported problems—all in one place.

The system includes smart features like editable user profiles, a searchable listing page that shows which properties are available or occupied, a notice board where users can react to posts, and a simple issue-reporting form. It’s designed to work smoothly across all devices, making it accessible and convenient for everyone.

Technology Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend (Optional): PHP, Node.js, or Python

Database: MySQL or MongoDB

Design Tools: Figma, Lucidchart

In short, Digital Mahaveer brings efficiency, transparency, and smarter communication to community living.
